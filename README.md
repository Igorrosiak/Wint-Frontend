# Wint-Frontend
This project was created in 2022 at Senai, and I refactored all the code in 2023/2024 to make it clean and usable.

It consists of a Web Page for a Portfolio Social Network.

This application uses: React, Typescript, Firebase, React Google Maps API, SASS, React Bootstrap, React Icons, React Alice Carousel and React Router DOM.

You can use it running "npm install" in the main path terminal AND running "npm start" after installing all dependencies.
